# AB-Testing
Data exploration and analytics over AB testing on the Cookie Cats, a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. 
# Problem
Where should the gates be placed?
# Solution
In this project, we're going to analyze an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 -control- to level 40 -test-. In particular, we will look at the impact on player retention.
# Data explore and visualization
We did first come data exploration to understand a bit more of the data set.
